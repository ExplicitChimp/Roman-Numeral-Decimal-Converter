# Roman-Numeral-Decimal-Converter
A simple Python Program that converts a roman numeral to decimal.

This project came about from a challenge to write the program in as many different languages as possible.
This will be the eventual aim.

Any collaborations welcome.

The aim of the program is to firstly explain the roman numerals and what each numeral represents numericaly.
It then askes for the user to input a numeral that they wish to convert to decimal.
Once executed the programme will output the interger. If a valid numeral is not entered the user will be told.
