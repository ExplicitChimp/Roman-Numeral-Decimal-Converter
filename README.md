# Roman-Numeral-Decimal-Converter

A simple program that converts a given Roman Numeral to decimal.
THe first upload will be in Python. 

This project came about from an online challenge to write the program in as many different languages as possible.
The eventual aim will be to have as many in the repo as we can.

Contained in the repo is an image file of Roman Numerals and their relevant integer.

All collaborations welcome.

The aim of the program is to firstly explain the roman numerals and what each numeral represents numericaly.
It then askes the user to input a numeral that they wish to convert to decimal.
Once executed the programme will output the interger. If a valid numeral is not entered the user will be told.
