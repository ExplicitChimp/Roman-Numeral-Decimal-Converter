# Roman-Numeral-Decimal-Converter
A simple Python Program that converts a roman numeral to decimal.

This project came about from a challenge to write the program in as many different languages as possible.
This will be the eventual aim.

Any collaborations welcome.

The program firstly explains the roman numerals and what each numeral represents numericaly.
It then askes for the user to input a numeral that they wish to convert to decimal.
